# Git directions
- echo "# sage-dessert-store" >> README.md ---> this is how you create a read me file
- `git init` --> this is what initialises your local(personal) bucket
- `git add README.md` --> this adds the read me file to your bucket
- `git add .` --> this adds any new changes to your bucket 
- `git commit -m 'comment'` "label of yout comment(a descriptive description of what you did and what you are adding)" --> this labels the addition and dumps it
- `git branch -M main` --> this is the branch
- `git remote add origin https://github.com/Sagelord00000001/sage-dessert-store.git` --> this is how you link your personal bucket to the online version (you need to do this only once)
- `git push -u origin main` --> this is how you push to the online bucket that everyone can see

## how to add any new changes
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m 'comment'`
- `git push`
